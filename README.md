This repository now stores the frontend React application inside `client/`, alongside the existing backend and Docker assets.

- Frontend React app: `client/`
- Backend scaffolding: `server/`
- Docker utilities: `docker/`

## Frontend (client)

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

The usual build, lint, and preview scripts are still available from within `client/`.

## Backend

The `server/` directory is reserved for backend code. Add your server implementation there.

## Docker

Container definitions and helper scripts live in `docker/`.
