  }
}

**CATEGORIZATION RULES:**

**TECH Category:**
⚠️ CRITICAL: This is the PRIMARY category for technical professionals.

Include ANY role that involves:
- Software development, engineering, programming (ANY level: junior to senior)
- DevOps, SRE, system administration, infrastructure
- Data science, ML engineering, AI development
- QA, test automation, security engineering, cybersecurity
- Technical architecture, technical leadership, CTO

**PRIMARY INDICATORS (ANY ONE is sufficient for TECH classification):**
✅ Job title contains: "engineer", "developer", "architect", "devops", "programmer", "coder", "software", "tech lead", "data scientist", "ML engineer", "AI", "full stack", "backend", "frontend"
✅ Tech stack with 2+ technologies mentioned (Python, Java, React, Node.js, AWS, Docker, etc.)
✅ Technical responsibilities described ("developed", "built", "implemented", "architected", "coded", "designed APIs", "deployed")

**STRICT EXCLUSIONS (DO NOT CLASSIFY AS TECH):**
❌ **Military/Defense "Technician" or "Operator" roles:**
   - Titles like "Technician", "System Operator", "Controller", "Administrator" in a military context are **MILITARY**, NOT TECH, unless they explicitly involve *writing code* (Python, C++, Java) or *building software*.
   - Using a complex system (e.g., "Air Defense System", "Control Room") is NOT Tech experience.
   - "Technician" is NOT "Engineer".
❌ **Academic Roles:**
   - "Student", "Teaching Assistant", "Research Assistant" (unless full-time dev), "Tutor".
   - "Projects" done during university (e.g., "Data Projects", "Final Project") are **NOT** professional experience. Exclude them completely or put in OTHER.
❌ **Generic Support:**
   - "Help Desk", "IT Support" (unless it involves scripting/DevOps).

**SPECIAL RULE FOR MILITARY/DEFENSE:**
If a military/defense role has ANY technical indicators above, classify as TECH, NOT MILITARY.
**BUT BE CAREFUL:** Only classify as TECH if it is a **Development/Engineering** role.
- "Software Engineer at Unit 8200" → TECH
- "Cybersecurity Researcher" → TECH
- "Technician of Air Defense System" → MILITARY (User/Maintainer, not Developer)
- "Air Traffic Controller" → MILITARY

**When in doubt between TECH and OTHER categories:**
→ If there's ANY code, development, or engineering work mentioned → Choose TECH
→ Technical experience is VALUABLE and should be recognized accurately

**MILITARY Category:**
Include ONLY formal military/defense service:
- Mandatory or professional military service
- Defense contractors/units
- Intelligence or cybersecurity in military context (IF NOT clearly Software/Data Engineering)

**HOSPITALITY Category:**
Include roles in:
- Hotels, restaurants, catering
- Tourism, travel services
- Customer service in hospitality context

**OTHER Category:**
Everything else: sales, marketing, finance, admin, education, retail, etc.
**Include Academic/Student roles here if they must be kept.**

**CRITICAL RULES:**

1. **Inclusion Criteria:**
   ✅ Include: Formal paid employment at companies, organizations, startups
   ✅ Include: Paid internships with clear employment status
   ❌ Exclude: Volunteer work, personal projects, academic projects, hackathons
   ❌ Exclude: Education (even if it mentions technical coursework)
   ❌ Exclude: Non-tech roles when categorizing tech experience

2. **Date Handling:**
   - Parse dates accurately: "2020", "Jan 2020", "2020-01", "2020-2022"
   - For "present", "current", "now" → calculate to today's date
   - Merge overlapping periods within same category (avoid double-counting)
   - Example: "2020-2022" at Company A + "2021-2023" at Company A (promotion) = 3 years total, not 5

3. **Confidence Scoring:**
   - 0.9-1.0: Clear job title, company name, dates, and category
   - 0.7-0.8: Minor ambiguity (unclear dates or generic title)
   - 0.5-0.6: Significant ambiguity (looks like project work or unclear employment)
   - <0.5: High uncertainty (may not be real employment)

4. **Role Normalization:**
   - Fix obvious typos: "SOFTWARE ENGAINER" → "Software Engineer"
   - Standardize variations: "Full Stack Dev" → "Full Stack Developer"
   - Translate non-English titles to English: "מהנדס תוכנה" → "Software Engineer"
   - Never invent or add information not in the source

5. **Reasoning:**
   Provide clear, concise explanations in English:
   - "Included: Technical role at established tech company with clear dates"
   - "Excluded: Personal project without formal employment"
   - "Clustered as TECH: Strong technical stack (Python, AWS, Docker) despite ambiguous title"

6. **Primary Years Calculation:**
   - Set "recommended_primary_years.tech" ONLY if there are actual tech roles
   - Use the total_years from the tech cluster
   - Set to null if no tech experience or confidence < 0.6

**QUALITY CHECKS:**
- Ensure no role is counted twice
- Verify date ranges are logical (start < end)
- Validate totals_by_category sums match cluster totals
- Check that all years are ≥ 0
- Ensure confidence scores are between 0 and 1

**OUTPUT:**
Return ONLY the JSON object. No explanations, comments, or text outside the JSON structure.
